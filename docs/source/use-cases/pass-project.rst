PAss Private Assisted House
===========================

The team, headed by `Francesco De Angelis <https://francescodeangelis.org/>`_, is working together with `INRCA <http://www.inrca.it/>`_ and `Regione Marche <http://www.regione.marche.it/>`_ on a complete platform that integrates and coordinates home automation, telemedicine solutions, and smart objects in a single house or structure. A "smart house" meta-model was developed as a result of a multidisciplinary collaboration between `University of Camerino (Architecture and Computer Science) <http://international.unicam.it/>`_, `Santo Stefano Rehabilitation Institute <http://www.sstefano.it/>`_ and many manufacturers located in the Marche region. These manufacturers produce hardware, telemedicine devices, and also integrate everyday objects in an effort to make them "smart" using some form of sensors/actuators.

`Freedomotic <http://www.freedomotic.com/>`_ was chosen as the platform for integration of domestic smart objects (sensors and actuators) in the home environment. These objects can communicate through a home gateway using a JSON payload carried via `MQTT <http://mqtt.org/>`_.

The purpose of this is:

#. generating local in-house events to be fed to Freedomotic and create automations according to pre-defined rules.
#. carrying the same data to a datacenter that integrates house-related information with telemedicine data, and implements ad-hoc algorithms, with respect to the disability/disease of those who live in the house, activating remote control mechanisms that can raise alerts to a caregiver or trigger in-house automations externally.

For example, one partner is developing an app that uses Bayesian networks to control the "normal" patients' behavior. One of the project aims is about developing a mobile UI to be given to health care professionals and patients themselves.

This should greatly simplify the daily operations inside the house. It is not intended, at this time, to let users configure their house environment and its devices.
